# Awesome Demos Done Quick

Lightning talk about JXA (done with JXA)

## Prerequisites

Run `./present.js --prepare=1` to check for required applications

It is possible that this talk also needs some additional permissions, which I've set a long time ago on my main Mac and about which I've forgot

## Structure

- `present.js` is the main script
- `prepare.js` checks for prereqs
- `actions/*.js` are separate "slides"
- `thingist.js` is an example of good and actually useful JXA script
- `jxargv.js` helps with parsing CLI arguments
